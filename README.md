Application of GAN to NMT Task

<br>
<br>

## Model

**BaseLine**

> 

<br>

**GAN**

> In this part, the generator and discriminator train via adversarial way.

<br>

**Two-Step Training**

> First the model trained on the object of minimizing the loss, which aims to learn how to generate translated sentences.
And then, the model be trained again with same dataset but with different objective of minimizing Disciminator's negative predition.
